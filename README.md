### [Roadmap](wiki/Roadmap)

Before we even get to a proper readme I'd like to start giving credits to those that made this project possible:

## Special Thanks

-   [SmartHomeBeginner.com](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/) for creating [AtoMiC-ToolKit](https://github.com/htpcBeginner/AtoMiC-ToolKit) that served as this project's primary inspiration, and later [this](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/) guide that provided some initial direction with Docker.
-   [LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) for maintaining the majority of the Docker images used in this project.
